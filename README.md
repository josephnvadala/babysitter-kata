# Don't forget to Install: npm install

# How To Run: node .

# How To Run Tests: npm run test

# Assumptions:

# 1. Since the babysitter cannot start before 5pm, no times entered can be before 5pm

# 2. Bedtime and Start Time are not necessarily before midnight (although they likely are in most scenarios)

# 3. Bedtime could be after midnight, but all hours past midnight will be considered hours for After-Midnight pay as it's the higher amount

# 4. Bed time cannot be before start time

# 5. End time cannot be before bed time

# 6. For Console App purposes only: Assumed Babysitter COULD select a bed time that was the same as the start time OR an end time the same as the bed time
